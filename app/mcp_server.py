"""Family MCP surface — engineered for what LLM agents ACTUALLY read.

Channel priority (see docs/MCP_DESIGN.md): agents reliably see (1) tool
names/descriptions/param schemas and (2) tool results & error strings.
Server ``instructions`` and resources are inconsistently surfaced across
clients, and prompts are user-invoked. Therefore:

  * trigger phrases (中文 + EN) live IN the tool descriptions — that is what
    drives correct tool selection;
  * every error string is coaching: it says what to call instead, so a wrong
    call self-corrects in one round trip;
  * results carry the running unpaid total so the agent can confirm naturally;
  * ``expenses_help`` returns the full playbook — works even on clients that
    never show instructions;
  * three personas ship as MCP prompts (记账 / 对账 / 修复) for clients that
    expose prompt templates.

MCP requires Auth0 OAuth bearer tokens and approved household permissions.

家庭开支 Family Expenses — playbook for assistants.

WHAT THIS IS: one household's simple ledger of expenses that still need to be
paid (待付) or were paid (已付). Amounts are CNY (¥). Users speak casually,
Chinese or English. Always reply in the user's language.

INTENT → TOOL:
- "我还要付什么 / what do I owe / 有什么没付" → expenses_list(status="unpaid")
- "足球课300块 / football 300" → expenses_add(amount="300", description="足球课")
- "昨天交了300的足球课(已经付了)" → expenses_add(..., paid=true, paid_date=...)
- "足球课付了 / paid the football class / 交了" → expenses_mark_paid(query="足球课")
- "足球课改成350 / actually it was 350" → expenses_update(query="足球课", amount="350")
- "删掉/不用了 delete the swim class" → expenses_delete(query="游泳课") — confirm first
- "这个月花了多少 / totals" → expenses_list() and read .summary
- "这条是谁改的 / what happened to X" → expenses_history
- "给我老婆做个链接" → expenses_mint_link(label="wife") — link never expires
- "哪些链接还在用 / who has a link / list the links" → expenses_list_links
- "足球还剩几节课 / how many classes left / 还有几次" → classes_list
- "足球课交了2200，10节课 / paid for 10 classes" → classes_add (the payment must
  be in the ledger first — expenses_add, then classes_add(query=…))
- "今天上了足球课 / went today" → classes_log(kind="attended")
- "今天的课取消了 / they cancelled" → classes_log(kind="missed_school")
- "今天没去 / we skipped" → classes_log(kind="missed_us")
- "8月17、21、28都上了 / log these three dates" → classes_log(kind=…, dates=[…])
  — one call, all or nothing
- "那天没上，记错了 / undo that class / 删掉那条上课记录" →
  classes_log_delete(event_id=…) — ids from classes_list(verbose=true) or the
  classes_log result
- "退了1800 / 退款 / they refunded us 1800 / got money back" →
  expenses_refund(query=…, amount="1800"). The payment KEEPS its original
  amount; every total reads amount − refunds. A refund on a course usually
  means fewer classes: pass resize_package_to=<new class_count> in the SAME
  call so the per-class rate stays honest (¥3600 for 10 refunded ¥1800 is
  5 classes at ¥360, not 10 at ¥180)
- "那个退款记错了 / undo the refund" → expenses_refund_delete(refund_id=…) —
  confirm first. A course resized with the refund goes back to its previous
  class count too (unless something changed it since — the note says)
- "课时改成5 / 改成5节 / the pack is 5 classes now / rename the course /
  改名" → classes_update(query=…, class_count=5)
- "这个课结束了 / 上完了 / archive the course / retire it" →
  classes_update(query=…, archived=true) — keeps the log, hides it from lists
- "删掉这个课程 / stop tracking the course / remove the course" →
  classes_delete(query=…) — confirm first; its class log stays in the
  payment's expenses_history

CLASS TRACKER — two shapes, and they answer different questions:
- kind="per_class": a pack of N classes. Attending draws one down. Answers
  "how many classes and how much money is LEFT".
- kind="period": a flat month/semester fee. Nothing is drawn down; the classes
  that did NOT happen are owed back. Answers "what do they owe us" — split into
  reclaimable (missed_school: they cancelled) and forfeited (missed_us: we
  skipped). Both count toward the total owed; the cause is what you argue with.
A package carries NO money of its own: the rate is the linked payment's amount
÷ class_count. To correct the price, edit the EXPENSE, not the package.

CATEGORIES — prefer these EXACT keys. Anything else is accepted and counted as
an ordinary household expense (and charted under whatever string you sent), so
an invented key does not vanish — it just is not one of the household's buckets:
  living · aden-edu · aden-sports · aden-clothes · aden-other · food · home ·
  utilities · internet · mobile · transport · travel · entertainment ·
  clothes · medical · borrow · other

- "borrow" is the ONE category with arithmetic behind it: it means she paid out
  of her own pocket (or the company's) and is owed the money BACK. Only the
  exact string "borrow" does this — it is kept out of every household expense
  total and reported on its own. A synonym like "loan repayment" or
  "reimbursement" is NOT recognised: it counts as ordinary household spending
  and inflates the paid/unpaid totals instead. Use it for
  "垫付/她先付的/borrowed from her/she fronted it/I lent".
- "living" is the recurring monthly household payment (生活费).

RULES OF THUMB:
- Dates/paid dates: omit them — the server defaults to today in China time.
- Amounts: pass what the user said — "¥300", "300块", "1,200元" all parse.
- Every row's `amount` is the EFFECTIVE figure (after refunds); `gross_amount`
  and `refunded` say what was paid and what came back. expenses_update(amount=)
  sets the ORIGINAL figure — to change what came back, use the refund tools.
- Keep the user's own words as the description (don't translate it).
- query matching: substring on description/category — and for expenses_list
  also the linked course's name, so "羽毛球" finds a payment described
  "Badminton". If a tool returns matched>1 with candidates, show them briefly
  and ask which; then call again with expense_id. Never guess.
- Attribution is assigned by the server from the authenticated household member;
  submitted_by / changed_by / logged_by supplied by the client are ignored.
