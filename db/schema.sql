-- Family Expenses — schema (v0.2.0)
--
-- PORTABLE DDL: runs unmodified on Postgres (Neon, production) and sqlite
-- (tests). Rules that keep it portable:
--   * application-managed ISO-8601 UTC timestamps (TEXT) — no triggers,
--     no now()/to_char defaults;
--   * JSON audit snapshots stored as TEXT;
--   * no arrays, no PG-only expressions or casts;
--   * idempotent (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS) — applied at startup; dated
--     migration files begin only when a breaking change first appears.

-- ── class tracker (v0.10.0) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
-- A package is a course paid for by exactly ONE expense row, and it stores no
-- money of its own. The per-class rate is derived at read time from
-- expenses.amount / class_count, so correcting the payment corrects the
-- tracker and the two can never disagree — the same reason Store.summarize is
-- the only totals implementation for expenses.
--
-- expense_id is UNIQUE for that reason: two packages on one payment would each
-- claim the whole amount and silently double-count the money.

  id            TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  -- FK, not just a convention: the application refuses to delete a funding
  -- payment, but that check and the delete are not one atomic step under
  -- Postgres. Without this the loser of that race commits an orphan, and an
  -- orphan vanishes from every read (the package SELECT inner-joins expenses).
